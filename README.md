# INERA SOFTWARE QUICK-IS BETA V.1 (Frontend)

Welcome to the frontend repository for INERA SOFTWARE QUICK-IS BETA V.1. This application is a Business Intelligence (BI) platform designed to transform your business data into actionable insights, built with Next.js and React.

This project serves as the client-facing user interface and consumes data from a separate backend API.

## Architecture Overview

This project follows a decoupled, or "headless," architecture:

-   **Frontend (This Repository)**: A Next.js application responsible for all UI and user interaction. It fetches data from and sends data to the backend API.
-   **Backend (Separate Repository)**: A separate server built with a framework like **Python (Django, Flask)** or **Node.js (Express)**. The backend handles all business logic, database interactions, and data processing, exposing its services through a REST or GraphQL API.


## Core Features

-   **Data Analysis**: Upload your business data (CSV, XLSX) to analyze and visualize key trends.
-   **Advanced Analytics Suite**: Dive deep into your data with a comprehensive set of tools:
    -   **Forecasting Analyst**: Predict future sales, customer behavior, and inventory needs.
    -   **Problem & Suggestion Engine**: Identifies business problems from your data and provides solutions.
    -   **Visuals & Dashboards**: Create custom charts, KPIs, and interactive dashboards to monitor performance.
    -   **Audit Zone**: Access a tailored compliance dashboard with company-specific rules, laws, and regulatory updates.
-   **Automated Document Generation**: Create professionally formatted documents like Business Requirement Documents (BRDs) and presentations (PPTs) directly from your data and analyses.
-   **Collaboration & Sharing**: Securely share insights, reports, and daily updates with your team.

## Getting Started (For Frontend Developers)

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
-   A running instance of the backend API server.

### 1. Configure Backend Connection

This application needs to know the URL of your backend API. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following line, replacing the URL with the actual address of your running backend server.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and install the required npm packages.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend application in development mode. You can view it by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. The application will make API calls to the URL you configured in the `.env` file.
